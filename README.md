The assignment is focused on two topics: Scrum and Microservices-Git-CI. For the Scrum portion, the student is required to answer questions related to a scenario given involving a team working on a project over three sprints. The questions include counting the number of story-points the team completed in each sprint and in total, calculating the velocity, drawing a burndown chart, and determining the number of sprints needed to complete the remaining story-points. The student is also required to provide suggestions to improve the velocity of the team.

For the Microservices-Git-CI portion, the student is tasked with creating a Microservice for an online shop's item management system. The code will be kept on Github and the Dev branch will be used for implementation. Feature branches will be used for implementing each feature and merged into the Dev branch when ready. The student will be required to set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate the build, run, and test processes.

I have first pushed the skeleton spring boot code with required packages in it to the master branch.
I have then set up the CI through Actions.
I have created a branch named develop from master.
I have then created a feature branch for each class from the develop branch. When I finished implementing the class, I switched to the develop branch and merged the feature branch.
I have repeated this process for all the required classes. 
I have then switched to master and merged the develop branch.
