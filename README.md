# sept_challenge1

I have first pushed the skeleton spring boot code with required packages in it to the master branch.
I have then set up the CI through Actions.
I have created a branch named develop from master.
I have then created a feature branch for each class from the develop branch. When I finished implementing the class, I switched to the develop branch and merged the feature branch.
I have repeated this process for all the required classes. 
I have then switched to master and merged the develop branch.
